# Text Endpoints

Two endpoints for programmatic access to documentation content.

## `/llms-full.txt`

Returns **all documentation pages** combined into one text file.

```
https://docs.versend.io/llms-full.txt
```

Use this when you want to give an AI the complete documentation context.

## `.mdx` suffix

Add `.mdx` to any page URL to get just that page as plain text.

```
/docs/installation/requirements → /docs/installation/requirements.mdx
```

Use this when you only need context about a specific topic.
