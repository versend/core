# Setup Vercel Webhook

Now configure Vercel to send deployment events to your Versend instance.

<Steps>
<Step>

### Open Webhook Settings

Go to your Vercel Dashboard → **Settings** → **Webhooks** (at the account,
team, or project level depending on what you want to monitor).

</Step>
<Step>

### Create a New Webhook

Click **Create Webhook** and configure:

- **Endpoint URL**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/hook`
- **Events**: Select the deployment events you want to receive

Replace `your-domain.vercel.app` with your actual Versend deployment domain.

</Step>
<Step>

### Save the Secret

After creating the webhook, Vercel will show you a **signing secret**.

<Callout type="warn">
  Copy this secret immediately — you'll need it for the
  `WEBHOOK_INTEGRATION_SECRET` environment variable.
</Callout>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Filtering by Project

You can filter which projects trigger notifications by choosing where to create the webhook:

- **Account/Team level**: Receives events from **all** projects in the account/team
- **Project level**: Receives events from **only that project**

<Callout type="warn">
  Each Versend instance can only have **one** webhook secret. If you need to monitor multiple specific projects (but not all), create the webhook at the account/team level and all projects will be monitored.
</Callout>

For single-project monitoring, create the webhook directly in that project's settings.
