<Step>

### Get Your Webhook URL

Set up an endpoint to receive webhooks. This could be:

- **Zapier**: Create a Zap with "Webhooks by Zapier" trigger
- **n8n**: Create a workflow with "Webhook" trigger node
- **Make**: Create a scenario with "Webhooks" module
- **Custom**: Any URL that accepts POST requests with JSON body

</Step>
<Step>

### Add Environment Variable

Add this to your Vercel project:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    WEBHOOK_URL: {
      description: 'URL to forward webhooks to',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
    },
  }}
/>

</Step>
<Step>

## Payload Format

The endpoint receives the raw Vercel webhook payload:

```json
{
  "id": "webhook_xxx",
  "type": "deployment.succeeded",
  "createdAt": 1234567890,
  "payload": {
    "deployment": { ... },
    "links": { ... },
    ...
  }
}
```

## Headers

Each request includes:

| Header | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` |
| `User-Agent` | `Versend/1.0` |
| `X-Versend-Event` | Event type (e.g., `deployment.succeeded`) |

## Use Cases

- **Zapier/Make automation**: Trigger workflows on deployments
- **Custom dashboards**: Aggregate deployment data
- **Audit logging**: Store all deployment events
- **Multi-service fanout**: Forward to multiple internal services
