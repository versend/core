# Providers

Versend supports multiple notification providers. Configure one or many — notifications are sent to all enabled providers in parallel.

## Available Providers

| Provider | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [Discord](/docs/providers/discord) | ✅ Stable | Rich embeds with colors, fields, and links |
| [Telegram](/docs/providers/telegram) | ✅ Stable | HTML-formatted messages via Bot API |

## How It Works

Each provider is **auto-enabled** when its required environment variables are set:

- **Discord**: Set `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` → Discord enabled
- **Telegram**: Set `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` + `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID` → Telegram enabled

Enable as many as you need.
