# Providers

Versend supports multiple notification providers. Configure one or many — notifications are sent to all enabled providers in parallel.

## Available Providers

| Provider | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [Discord](/docs/providers/discord) | ✅ Stable | Rich embeds with colors, fields, and links |
| [Slack](/docs/providers/slack) | ✅ Stable | Block Kit messages via incoming webhooks |
| [Telegram](/docs/providers/telegram) | ✅ Stable | HTML-formatted messages via Bot API |
| [Generic Webhook](/docs/providers/webhook) | ✅ Stable | Forward raw payload to any URL |

## How It Works

Each provider is **auto-enabled** when its required environment variables are set. No code changes needed — just add the env vars and redeploy.

Enable as many providers as you need. Notifications are sent to all enabled providers in parallel.
