# Requirements

Before setting up Versend, make sure you have:

1. A **Vercel account** with at least one project you want to monitor
2. At least one [notification provider](/docs/providers) configured
3. (Optional) An **Upstash account** for rate limiting

<Callout type="warn">
  Without rate limiting, your endpoint is exposed to abuse and spam. It is recommended to use rate limiting for production.
</Callout>
