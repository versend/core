# Requirements

Before setting up Vercord, make sure you have:

1. A **Vercel account** with at least one project you want to monitor
2. At least one notification provider:
   - **Discord** — a server where you have "Manage Webhooks" permission
   - **Telegram** — a bot created via [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
3. (Optional) An **Upstash account** for rate limiting

<Callout type="info">
  You can use Discord, Telegram, or both. See the [Providers](/docs/providers) section for setup guides.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warn">
  Without rate limiting, your endpoint is exposed to abuse and spam. It is recommended to use rate limiting for production.
