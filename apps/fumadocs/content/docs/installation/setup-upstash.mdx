# Setup Upstash Redis

Versend uses Upstash Redis for rate limiting. Add the credentials and it's enabled. No credentials = no rate limiting.

<Callout type="error">
  **Skipping this step?** Without rate limiting, your webhook endpoint is vulnerable to:

  - **Abuse**: Malicious actors can spam your endpoint
  - **DDoS**: Your endpoint can be overwhelmed by excessive requests
  - **Resource exhaustion**: Uncontrolled requests increase costs
  - **Discord spam**: Excessive requests could get your webhook disabled by Discord

  Only skip if you have alternative protection (Cloudflare, Vercel Firewall, etc.).
</Callout>

### Create a Redis Database

Click **Create Database** and configure:

- **Name**: Anything (e.g., `versend`)
- **Region**: Choose the region closest to your Vercel deployment (usually `us-east-1` for Vercel)
- **Type**: Regional is fine

</Step>

### Copy the Credentials

In your database dashboard, find the **REST API** section and copy:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

<Callout type="warn">
  Save these values — you'll need them for the environment variables.
