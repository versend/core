# Setup Upstash Redis

Vercord uses Upstash Redis for rate limiting to prevent abuse. Rate limiting is **optional** and can be enabled or disabled via the `ENABLE_RATE_LIMITING` environment variable.

<Callout type="error">
  **Security Warning**: Disabling rate limiting removes protection against abuse and DDoS attacks. Only disable rate limiting if you understand the security implications and have alternative protection mechanisms in place (e.g., Vercel's built-in rate limiting, Cloudflare, or other DDoS protection). Without rate limiting, your webhook endpoint is vulnerable to being overwhelmed by malicious or excessive requests.
